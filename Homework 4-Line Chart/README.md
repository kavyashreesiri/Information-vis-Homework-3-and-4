__Line Chart(AidData)__
1. List the marks/channels used and the data/attributes they map to  
	* __Line__  is the  *mark* type used.(Points joined by lines)

	* __Channels__ are:   
		* __Vertical__ spatial position channel    
		* __Horizontal__ spatial position channel

	* __Attributes__ are :
   
		* __Total Donation amount (in US Dollars)__ is *quantitative* data plotted in 		*vertical spatial position channel*.
		* __Year__ is  *Ordered* data which is plotted in  *horizontal spatial position channel*.(Year of donation in ascending order)

2. Explanation of Line Chart implemented
	* Chart shows the __Trend/growth__ of Total Donation amount as the years pass from 1991 to 2010 
  
3. Interesting insights 
	
	* Growth in Donation amount has increased as the years passed 
	* But the growth is not consistent
	* Donation amount has increased to 80,000,000 Dollars from 0 Dollars from between 1991 to  1994 Mid(1993 year's data is not there in the given Data file),later  flattened off to 0 Dollars after Mid-1995 
	* Again,Donation amount increased from later half of the 1996 to 1998.
	* There was a fall after 1998 till 2007 with irregular trend
	* There is gradual increase in Donated amount from Mid-2007  to 2010
	* Prediction :Donation amount will keep increasing as the years pass after 2010
