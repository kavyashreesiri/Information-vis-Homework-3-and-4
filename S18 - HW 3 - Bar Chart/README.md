__BAR CHART__
1. What is the type of mark used in the bar chart?   
   __Line__  is the  *mark*  type used in the Bar Chart. 

* List the channels, the attribute they are mapped to, and the data type of that attribute.   
 * __Channels__ are:
     * __Vertical__ spatial position channel 
     * __Horizontal__ spatial position channel    
   (Using Length to get position)
 * __Attributes__ are :
   
     * __Frequency of Alphabets__ is quantitative data plotted in *vertical spatial position channel*.
     * __Alphabets__  are  *categorical* data which is plotted in  *horizontal spatial position channel*.

* After your changes, list the channels, the attribute they are mapped to, and the data type of that attribute.   
 * __Chart 1__   
Channels are:  
     *  *Vertical*  spatial position channel mapped to __frequency of alphabet__ which is quantitative type attribute
     *  *Horizontal* spatial position channel mapped to __alphabet(letter)__ which is categorical type attribute
     *  *Hue* mapped to the  __alphabet(letter)__ which is categorical type attribute   
 * __Chart 2__    
  Channels are:  
     *  *Vertical* spatial position channel mapped to __frequency of alphabet__ which is quantitative type attribute
     *  *Horizontal* spatial position channel mapped to __alphabet(letter)__ which is categorical type attribute
     *  *Saturation* mapped to the __frequency of alphabet(letter)__ which is quantitative type attribute
